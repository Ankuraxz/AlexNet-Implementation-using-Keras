# AlexNet-Implementation-using-Keras
Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton and Ilya Sutskever created a neural network architecture called ‘AlexNet’ and won Image Classification Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012. They trained their network on 1.2 million high-resolution images into 1000 different classes with 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons. The training was done on two GPUs with split layer concept because GPUs were a little bit slow at that time.
